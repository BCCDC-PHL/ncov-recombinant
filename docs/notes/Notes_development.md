# Development

## To DO

### Priority

1. Add a `tutorial` profile.

    - (N=2) Designated Recombinants (pango-designation)
    - (N=2) Proposed Recombinants (issues, UCSC)
    - (N=2) Unpublished Recombinants
    - (N=2) Non Recombinant

### Misc

1. Remove nwk output from `usher` and `usher_subtrees`:

    - Pull subtree sample names from json instead

1. Troubleshoot `sc2rf` update to `bd2a4009` which drops all deltacrons.

    - The last stable commit was `5ac8d04`.

1. Remove the `resources` in config.yaml.
1. Investigate the reasons that X* lineages are excluded by `sc2rf`.
1. Add citations to report.
1. Update UShER to 0.5.3.
1. Plot recombinant breakpoints differently.
1. Edit Auspice json to change default colorings,filters,and panels (also sort).
1. Automate unit test update.
1. Not implemented recombinant lineages:

    - XA | Alpha recombinant (poor lineage accuracy)
    - XB | Conflicting designation [issue](https://github.com/summercms/covid19-pango-designation/commit/26b7359e34a0b2f122215332b6495fea97ff3fe7)
    - XC | Alpha recombinant (poor lineage accuracy)
    - XK | No public genomes
    - XL | No public genomes
    - XN
    - XP
    - XR
    - XT  
    - XU
