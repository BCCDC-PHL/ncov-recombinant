# Development

1. Add lineage `XM` to controls.

    - There are now publicly available samples.

## To DO

1. Plot recombinant breakpoints differently.
1. Summarize recombinants by parents and dates observed.
1. Maybe change `summary` to `line list`?
1. Edit Auspice json to change default colorings,filters,and panels.
1. Automate unit test update.
1. Test the `exclude_clades` param of Nextclade to make sure it isn't removing.
1. Not implemented recombinant lineages:

    - XA | Alpha recombinant (poor lineage accuracy)
    - XB | Conflicting designation [issue](https://github.com/summercms/covid19-pango-designation/commit/26b7359e34a0b2f122215332b6495fea97ff3fe7)
    - XC | Alpha recombinant (poor lineage accuracy)
    - XK | No public genomes
    - XL | No public genomes
    - XN
    - XP
    - XR
    - XT  
    - XU
