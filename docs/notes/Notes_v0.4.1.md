# v0.4.1

This is a minor bug fix release with the following changes:

- [Issue #63](https://github.com/ktmeaton/ncov-recombinant/issues/63): Remove `usher` and `protobuf` from the conda environment.
- [Issue #68](https://github.com/ktmeaton/ncov-recombinant/issues/68): Remove [ncov](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov) as a submodule.
- [Issue #69](https://github.com/ktmeaton/ncov-recombinant/issues/69): Remove 22C and 22D from `sc2rf/mapping.csv` and `sc2rf/virus_properties.json`, as these interfere with breakpoint detection for XAN.
