# v0.4.2

This is a minor bug fix and enhancement release with the following changes:

## Plot

- New parameter `--lineage-col` was added to `scripts/plot_breakpoints.py` to have more control on whether we want to plot the raw lineage (`lineage`) or the curated lineage (`recombinant_lineage_curated`).
